#To-Do List
##Description
This project involved creating a persistent "To-Do List" program that users can view, update, delete, and mark their To-Do's as completed. The To-Do List will save and maintain its state even after the user quits the program. The model skeleton is courtesy of Justin Herrick and can be viewed at <a ref="https://github.com/tiy-austin-ror-may2015/model-skeleton"> his Github</a>.

##Installation

##How to Use
